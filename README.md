##Introduction to modern CMake and file organization / structure.

Hello, I am Alexander Williams-Letondre, a student at the university of lethbridge.
I have finally had the chance to properly understand how to begin developing in a
modern cmake environment. This revolution, means I can finally start compiling
binaries from open source companies, and integrate libraries from different
source codes into a new, developed, project.

My hope is that by combining this and some middleware, like openGL, and maybe some
python, I might be able to begin developing larger scale software.

If you want to learn more about me, I have a README in my original repository,
right here on github. If you want to learn more about some specific code, please
enter one of the files associated with some project.
